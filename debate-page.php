          <p>The Democratic National Committee isn't playing fair. They've scheduled <strong>six debates</strong> between the 2016 Democratic Presidential Candidates, <strong>over 4 times fewer</strong> than the 26 held in the 2008 election cycle. This will severely limit voters' understanding of each candidate, especially those that aren't household names.</p>
          <p>To make matters worse, the DNC <strong>forbids</strong> candidates from participating in debates that are not organized by the DNC. This is <em>not about Bernie Sanders</em>. This is <em>not about Hillary Clinton</em>. This is about having <strong>well-informed voters</strong>, a cornerstone of democracy.</p>
          <p>Another cornerstone of democracy is <strong>getting involved</strong>!
          <br/>Make a difference right now by joining our #WeWantDebate campaign.</p>

                      <p><strong>Call the DNC at (202) 863-8000</strong></p>
                      <p class="sample">Hello.<br/>My name is [Name] of [City, State] and I am calling the Democratic National Committee today regarding the upcoming Democratic primary debates. As of now, there are six primary debates planned; in the 2008 election cycle, there were twenty-six debates, which is over four times as many. I urge that the DNC increases the number of debates, as called for by Governor O'Malley and Senator Sanders, so that we may be better informed on the candidates. Thank you for your time.</p>
                      <p><strong>Send the DNC an email</strong> using their <a href="http://my.democrats.org/page/s/contact-the-democrats" target="_blank">official form</a></p>
                      <p class="sample">Dear Mrs. Wasserman Schultz,<br/><br/>
                        I am contacting you today in regards to the upcoming Democratic primary debates. As of now, there are six primary debates scheduled; in the 2008 election cycle, there were twenty-six debates, which shows a decrease in the number of debates by over four times. In an effort to become an informed voter, I feel I have exhausted my options for learning about each candidate's stances and opinions through their official campaign publications. However, seeing how candidates contrast each other when debating is a key part in deciding who to support. Six debates are far too few to make an informed decision about who should represent the Democratic Party in the 2016 general election, especially considering that these are the only debates in which the candidates can participate. I urge you to respect the requests of your supporters and of Senator Bernie Sanders and Governor Martin O'Malley by increasing the number of primary Democratic debates. The debates for the 2008 election cycle were fantastic as after twenty-six debates, I'm sure most can agree that the differences between the candidates were clear.<br/>
                        Thank you for representing the interests of the Democratic Party members.<br/><br/>
                        Sincerely,<br/>
                        [Name]
