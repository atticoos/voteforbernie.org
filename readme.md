VoteForBernie.org
===
This is the WordPress theme for voteforbernie.org

It was an MVP that I didn't do a lot of initial structuing for, so there's a bit of cleanup work to do to modernize it. If you think you can help make voteforbernie better, contact me.

### Immediate Goals
 * Implement color-blind-friendly patterns on map
 * Translate front page to Spanish
 * Create individual state pages for easy linking
 * Create widget to embed state lookup or specific state on other sites
 * Add links for checking registration online and registering to vote online, where available
 * Add form to submit corrections, notify of errors, etc.
